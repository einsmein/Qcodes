1. Added missing initialization of `self._RETRY_WRITE_ASK` and `self._RETRY_TIME` in the `write_raw` method to handle communication retries on VisaIOError.
2. Updated `set_field` to correctly recognize Standby as a valid final state when setting the magnetic field to 0â€¯T.
3. Modified `wait_while_ramping` to check the actual magnetic field value via `self._get_field()` instead of relying on the status byte, since the instrument may stay in the Ramping state even after reaching the target field.
4. Fixed unit parsing to handle unexpected trailing characters in the instrument's response. (e.g., "\r").
